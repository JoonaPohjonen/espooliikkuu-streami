  ## Overview

  This project was an early school task intended as an introduction to HTML5. Point of the project was to learn how to make a useful two-page website using only HTML and CSS. There was also a requirement to utilize atleast one fancy CSS element from a multitude of choises. I chose to use carousel in this project. Again, this was a very early school task long time ago. This is the reason it looks so barebones. We were also tasked to implement Wowza streaming player on the website to be used to view "Espoo liikkuu streami". "Espoo liikkuu streami" was an old sports event that was streamed by student from Metropolia University of Applied Scienses. unfortunately while writing this README, I noticed that the player is no longer working and for this reason wont be visible in the picture below.
